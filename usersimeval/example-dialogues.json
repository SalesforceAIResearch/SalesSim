Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component.

Look for reviews and ratings of the seller on the platform where you're purchasing the laptop. Pay attention to any red flags, such as a high number of returns, negative feedback, or complaints about customer service.\\n\\n2. **Brand Reputation**: If the laptop is from a brand you're not familiar with, do some research on the brand itself. Look for information about their history, customer support, and any available warranties or return policies. A reputable brand is more likely to stand behind its products and offer support if needed.\\n\\n3. **Product Reviews**: While your friend's positive experience is encouraging, it's essential to look at a broader range of reviews. Check multiple sources for reviews of the laptop, including tech websites, forums, and retail platforms. Pay attention to any recurring issues or complaints.\\n\\n4. **Specifications and Features**: Compare the specifications and features of the laptop with those of more well-known brands. If the specifications seem too good to be true for the price, it might be a sign of a counterfeit or low-quality product.\\n\\n5. **Warranty and Return Policy**: Ensure that the laptop comes with a warranty and that the seller has a clear return policy. This can provide some protection if you encounter any issues with the product.\\n\\n6. **Payment Method**: If possible, use a payment method that offers buyer protection, such as a credit card or a payment platform like PayPal. This can help you dispute the charge if something goes wrong with the purchase.\\n\\n7. **Customer Support**: Check if the seller or brand offers customer support and how responsive they are. Good customer support can be crucial if you encounter any problems with the laptop.\\n\\nIn summary, while it's possible to find good deals from lesser-known sellers, it's essential to do your due diligence. Check the seller's and brand's reputations, read a wide range of reviews, and ensure that you have some form of protection, such as a warranty or buyer protection through your payment method.

Each has its own strengths and is suited to different types of users.\\n\\n2. **Display**: Consider the size, resolution, and type of display. Larger displays and higher resolutions generally offer a better viewing experience but come at a higher cost.\\n\\n3. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU is the brain of your laptop. Intel and AMD are the main manufacturers. For general use, an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 is sufficient. For more demanding tasks, consider an i7 or Ryzen 7.\\n\\n4. **RAM**: This affects how many programs you can run simultaneously. 8GB is a good starting point for most users, but 16GB or more is better for multitasking and heavy applications.\\n\\n5. **Storage**: SSDs are faster and more reliable than traditional HDDs. Aim for at least 256GB of SSD storage, but 512GB or more is ideal for storing large files and applications.\\n\\n6. **Graphics**: Integrated graphics are sufficient for most users, but if you plan to game or do heavy video editing, consider a laptop with a dedicated graphics card (GPU).\\n\\n7. **Battery Life**: Check the battery life specifications. Longer battery life is crucial if you need to use your laptop on the go.\\n\\n8. **Ports**: Ensure the laptop has the ports you need, such as USB-C, HDMI, or a memory card reader.\\n\\n9. **Keyboard and Trackpad**: A comfortable keyboard and responsive trackpad are important for productivity.\\n\\n10. **Build Quality and Design**: Consider the laptop's build quality, weight, and design. Some laptops are more durable and portable than others.\\n\\n11. **Upgradability**: Some laptops allow you to upgrade components like RAM or storage, which can extend the laptop's useful life.\\n\\n12. **Price**: Set a budget and find the best laptop within that range. More expensive laptops often come with better specs and build quality.\\n\\n13. **Brand and Support**: Consider the brand's reputation and the availability of customer support. Some brands are known for better after-sales service.\\n\\n14. **Additional Features**: Look for features like a backlit keyboard, touchscreen, or fingerprint reader, depending on your needs.\\n\\n15. **Type of Laptop\", 'turn': 1, 'knowledge_used': 'Other components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond.

When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component.

Let me break it down for you in simpler terms and address your concerns.\\n\\n**RAM (Random Access Memory)**:\\nRAM is like your laptop's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that your laptop is actively using. More RAM allows your laptop to handle more tasks at once without slowing down. For basic tasks like web browsing and checking emails, 4GB of RAM is usually sufficient. However, having 8GB can provide a smoother experience, especially if you have multiple tabs open or run other programs in the background.\\n\\n**Laptop Lifespan**:\\nThe lifespan of a laptop depends on several factors, including the brand, build quality, and how well it's maintained. On average, a well-maintained laptop can last between 3 to 5 years. Some high-quality laptops can last even longer. To maximize the lifespan of your laptop, make sure to:\\n- Keep it clean and free of dust.\\n- Avoid overheating by using it on a hard surface and not blocking the vents.\\n- Update the software and drivers regularly.\\n- Be gentle with the hardware, avoiding drops and spills.\\n\\n**Affordability**:\\nI understand that you're on a tight budget. It's important to find a balance between cost and quality. A laptop in the $200-$300 range can handle basic tasks, but it might not have the latest features or the longest lifespan. If you can stretch your budget a bit, you might find a more durable option that will last longer.\\n\\n**Simplifying the Process**:\\nTo make the process less overwhelming, focus on the key features that matter most to you:\\n- **Budget**: Set a clear budget and stick to it.\\n- **Basic Specs**: Look for a laptop with at least an Intel Celeron or AMD Athlon processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD.\\n- **Brand Reputation**: Consider well-known brands that offer good customer support.\\n- **Warranty**: Check if the laptop comes with a warranty for added peace of mind.\\n\\n**Taking Your Time**:\\nIt's completely normal to feel nervous about making a big purchase. Take your time to research and compare different options. Don't rush into a decision.

The alternative is an SSD or Solid State Drive. This is a chip-based storage solution that\u2019s much faster than a hard drive. It\u2019s also more expensive, but the price has been dropping steadily over the years. The good news is that most laptops now come with an SSD as standard. The bad news is that the capacity of SSDs is still lower than HDDs, and the price per gigabyte is still higher. So you\u2019ll need to decide how much storage you need and how much you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\\nThe other thing to consider is that SSDs are available in two different formats: SATA and NVMe.

The resolution of the display is the number of pixels it has, and it\u2019s usually expressed as width x height. The most common resolutions are 1920 x 1080 (Full HD), 2560 x 1600 (QHD), and 3840 x 2160 (4K UHD). The type of display is also important. The most common types are LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode). LCD displays are cheaper, but they have lower contrast ratios and worse viewing angles. OLED displays are more expensive, but they have better contrast ratios and wider viewing angles. They also have better color accuracy and deeper blacks.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

Windows laptops are versatile and widely used in business and gaming. MacBooks are popular for creative software and have a consistent user experience. Chromebooks are affordable and great for cloud-based applications.\\n\\n2. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU is the brain of your laptop. Intel and AMD are the main manufacturers. For general use, an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 is sufficient. For more demanding tasks, consider an Intel Core i7\/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7\/9.\\n\\n3. **RAM**: RAM (Random Access Memory) affects how many tasks your laptop can handle at once. For basic use, 8GB is fine. For multitasking or running heavy applications, 16GB or more is recommended.\\n\\n4. **Storage**: Storage capacity and type are crucial. SSDs (Solid State Drives) are faster and more reliable than HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Aim for at least 256GB of SSD storage. For more space, consider 512GB or 1TB.\\n\\n5. **Display**: Display size, resolution, and type matter. Common sizes are 13-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch. Full HD (1920x1080) resolution is standard, but 4K is available for sharper images. OLED displays offer better contrast and colors but are more expensive.\\n\\n6. **Battery Life**: Check the battery life specification. For portability, aim for at least 8 hours of battery life.\\n\\n7. **Ports and Connectivity**: Ensure the laptop has the ports you need (USB, HDMI, etc.) and supports the latest wireless standards (Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5).\\n\\n8. **Keyboard and Trackpad**: A comfortable keyboard and responsive trackpad are essential for productivity.\\n\\n9. **Upgradability**: Consider how easily you can upgrade components like RAM or storage in the future.\\n\\n10. **Type of Laptop**: Decide between a traditional laptop, a 2-in-1 (which can be used as a tablet), or a gaming laptop based on your needs.\\n\\nGiven your budget constraints, I would recommend looking at laptops with the following specifications:\\n\\n- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5', 'turn': 2, 'knowledge_used': 'Other components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond.

It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason.

It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': 'Well, I figured if I\u2019m gonna do this, I might as well give myself a little room for when my daughter needs to use it too.

However, the battery life on the ASUS VivoBook 15 is shorter. The HP Pavilion x360 offers a better balance of performance and battery life for your needs.\\n\\n**Other Touch-Screen Options**:\\nIf you're looking for a touch-screen laptop at a better price, consider the Lenovo Flex 5 2-in-1 Laptop.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component.

This adds to their versatility but also to their cost.\\n\\n### Which One is Right for You?\\n- **If you primarily need a laptop for tasks like browsing the web, checking emails, and word processing**, a traditional laptop might be sufficient and more cost-effective.\\n- **If you want a more interactive experience, enjoy using touch gestures, or need a device that can double as a tablet**, a touchscreen laptop would be a better choice.\\n\\nGiven your requirements for a straightforward, budget-friendly laptop for basic browsing and email, a traditional laptop might be the better fit.

However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"Yeah, let's start there.

Windows offers a wide range of laptops from different manufacturers, MacOS is exclusive to Apple laptops, and ChromeOS is known for its simplicity and affordability.\\n\\n2. **Display**: Consider the size, resolution, and type of display. Larger displays (15-inch or more) are great for multimedia and gaming, while smaller displays (13-inch) are more portable. Higher resolution displays offer sharper images, and touchscreen displays can enhance interactivity.\\n\\n3. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU is the brain of your laptop. Intel and AMD are the main manufacturers. Intel offers a range of processors from Celeron and Pentium (entry-level) to Core i3, i5, i7, and i9 (high-performance). AMD offers Ryzen 3, 5, 7, and 9 series. For everyday tasks, an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 is sufficient. For more demanding tasks, consider Core i5, i7, or Ryzen 5, 7.\\n\\n4. **Graphics**: Integrated graphics are sufficient for basic tasks, but for gaming or graphic-intensive work, a dedicated graphics card (GPU) from NVIDIA or AMD is recommended.\\n\\n5. **RAM**: Random Access Memory (RAM) affects your laptop's multitasking capabilities. For basic tasks, 4GB is the minimum, but 8GB is recommended for most users. For heavy multitasking, gaming, or video editing, consider 16GB or more.\\n\\n6. **Storage**: Laptops typically use SSDs (Solid State Drives) or HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). SSDs are faster and more reliable but more expensive. HDDs offer more storage capacity at a lower cost. Consider a laptop with an SSD for faster performance, or a combination of both for a balance of speed and capacity.\\n\\n7. **Battery Life**: Check the battery life specification, but keep in mind that real-world usage may vary. For portability, look for a laptop with at least 8 hours of battery life.\\n\\n8. **Ports**: Consider the number and type of ports you need, such as USB (Type-A and Type-C), HDMI, and SD card readers.\\n\\n9. **Keyboard and Touchpad**: A comfortable keyboard and precise touch\", 'turn': 1, 'knowledge_used': 'Other components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component.

Here are the most important factors to consider:\\n\\n1. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU is crucial as it affects the overall performance of your laptop. For most users, an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 is a good balance between price and performance. If you need more power for tasks like video editing or gaming, consider a Core i7, i9, or Ryzen 7, 9.\\n\\n2. **RAM**: Having enough RAM is essential for multitasking and running multiple applications simultaneously. For most users, 8GB is the minimum, but 16GB is recommended for better performance and future-proofing.\\n\\n3. **Storage**: Opt for an SSD (Solid State Drive) instead of an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) for faster boot times, quicker application loading, and improved overall performance. Aim for at least 256GB of storage, but consider 512GB or more if you need to store large files like videos or games.\\n\\n4. **Display**: A higher resolution display (Full HD or 4K) offers sharper images and better color accuracy.

Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document.

With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"Yeah, that would be great.

This should be sufficient for a full day of school and home use, as long as you're not running too many demanding applications at once.\\n\\nAs for the number of tabs, Chromebooks with 4GB of RAM should be able to handle running multiple tabs at once without too much lag. However, if you anticipate needing to run more demanding applications or have many tabs open at once, you may want to consider a Chromebook with 8GB of RAM.\\n\\nI can help you find a specific Chromebook model that would fit your needs. Would you like me to do that?\", 'turn': 3, 'knowledge_used': 'CPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"That really helps clarify how they're different.

The alternative is an SSD or Solid State Drive. This is a chip-based storage solution that\u2019s much faster than a hard drive. It\u2019s also more expensive, but the price has been dropping steadily over the years. The good news is that most laptops now come with an SSD as standard. The bad news is that the capacity of SSDs is still lower than HDDs, and the price per gigabyte is still higher. So you\u2019ll need to decide how much storage you need and how much you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\\nThe minimum capacity for a laptop is 128GB, but that\u2019s really only suitable for a Chromebook.

It\u2019s where you\u2019ll be spending most of your time, so it\u2019s important to get it right. The size of the display is measured diagonally, from corner to corner. The most common sizes are 13-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch. The size you choose will depend on your needs and your budget. A 13-inch laptop is more portable, but a 15-inch or 17-inch laptop will give you more screen real estate. The resolution of the display is measured in pixels, both horizontally and vertically. The higher the resolution, the sharper the image will be. The most common resolutions are 1920 x 1080 (Full HD), 2560 x 1600 (QHD), and 3840 x 2160 (4K UHD). The type of display is also important. The most common types are LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode). LCD displays are cheaper, but OLED displays offer better contrast and deeper blacks.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

OLED TVs\\nOLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. An OLED TV does not have a backlight like an LED. It uses thousands of diodes that are self-illuminating, and each diode can turn off and on individually. OLED TVs can display millions of colour variations and they are the only TV that can display \u2018true black\u2019 because the diodes can turn completely off or on. If you stand in front of a 4K OLED TV you\u2019ll be blown away by the colour of every image, how dark the blacks are in a night scene with stars, and how everything looks vivid and almost better than real life.\\nYou can learn more about how OLED works by reading OLED vs QLED \u2013 What should your next TV be?\\nFeatures to look for when buying a new TV\\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the options on different TVs.\\n1. Refresh rate\\nRefresh rate refers to how often your screen refreshes. If you have a 60Hz refresh rate, it will refresh 60 times every second. If you have a 120Hz refresh rate, your TV will refresh 120 times per second. If you have a gamer in the house or you watch fast-paced sports, you\u2019ll love how smooth action is when you have a TV with 120Hz. If you\u2019re just watching movies or TV, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz won\u2019t be that noticeable to you. Many of the latest TVs offer 120Hz refresh rate as a standard feature.\\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, you may want to take a look at the best gaming TVs of 2021.\\n2. HDMI and USB ports\\nWhen you buy a TV you\u2019ll want to take a look at the different ports it has. If you have a lot of external devices like cable boxes, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles, you\u2019ll want to make sure your new TV has enough spots to plug in all of your devices. Most new TVs have three HDMI ports, one HDMI ARC port for a soundbar or home receiver, and one or two USB ports. HDMI has also evolved to HDMI 2.1, and this upgrade supports higher resolution video and 4K refresh rates at 120Hz. If you have a gamer in the house, you\u2019ll want to choose a new TV with HDMI 2.1.\\n3. HDR\\nNew TVs have HDR (High Dynamic Range) as an option. Having HDR on your TV means your TV can produce better peak brightness, deeper black levels, and auto-adjust for improved contrast overall. The result is picture quality that\u2019s more realistic and authentic than a TV without HDR. Many of the latest TVs now offer HDR10 as the standard format.\\n4. Smart TVs\\nMost of the latest TVs are also smart TVs. They connect to your Wi-Fi and have pre-loaded apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ pre-installed. Some smart TVs have voice control too, so you can just say \u201cOK Google, open up YouTube.\u201d\\nYou can learn more about the different types of smart TVs by reading Learning about smart TV operating systems.\\n5. Sound quality\\nNew TVs have built-in speakers and use technology to boost and define output for movies, TV shows, and music. While the sound quality of a new TV is always going to be great, if you\u2019d like to boost it so you can enhance dialogue or put more emphasis on sound effects, you can choose a sound bar for an instant sound upgrade. You can find sound bars at various price points, some have additional speakers like subwoofers, and many offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so you can stream your playlists too.\\nSpecific types of TVs you can choose\\nOne of the easiest ways to choose a new TV is to find one based on your specific interest. There are gaming TVs and zTVs for the tech enthusiast. If you\u2019d like to stick to a low budget, you can also choose TVs under $500.\\n1. TVs for gamers\\nGaming TVS are a favourite among gamers for quite a few reasons. Gaming TVs have features built in to make console gaming a seamless experience. You can plug your console in and your TV will automatically detect it and choose the best settings for your specific game.\\n---\\nBefore you buy a new TV, you\u2019ll need to decide on TV resolution and TV backlight. To decide on the best resolution for you, it\u2019s helpful to know a few terms.\\n1. Resolution\\nResolution is the number of vertical pixels or dots that make up your TV\u2019s picture. Whether you have a 55-inch TV or a 30-inch TV, the more pixels your display has the better the overall image quality. You want your resolution to match the content you\u2019re watching, so if you normally watch a lot of 4K content, you\u2019ll want to choose a TV with 4K resolution.\\nYou can read more about pixels and resolution in the 4K TV Buying Guide.\\n2. Aspect ratio\\nAspect ratio is the ratio of the height to width of the display. It\u2019s important because it indicates how the TV can display different resolutions without stretching or adding blank space around the picture.\\n3. 1080P, 4K, or 8K resolution\\nThere are a few different resolutions you can choose when buying a new TV: 1080p Full HD, 4K, and 8K.\\n1080p TV has two million pixels (1920 x 1080)\\n4K Ultra HD TV has eight million pixels (3840 x 2160)\\n8K TV has approximately thirty-three million pixels (7,680 by 4,320)\\n4K is currently the most popular option for TVs. The picture quality is outstanding, there is a wide variety of choices for brand and TV type with 4K resolution, and you\u2019ll find 4K content on all streaming services including Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and many more. 8K TVs are available, but online content hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that level of resolution. If you\u2019re looking for a TV you can enjoy for years to come, a 4K TV is a great choice.\\nLED, QLED, or OLED\\nThere are a lot of different types of TV, but the main three terms you\u2019ll hear the most right now are LED, QLED, and OLED. You can also take a look at this article on Full array TV.\\n1. LED TVs\\nLED TVs are a popular display choice. LED stands for light emitting diode, and TVs of this type use hundreds or thousands of LEDs are the light source for the display. You can find LED TVs in 1080p, 4K, and 8K, with Ultra HD LED TVs being the most popular right now.\\nThe term LED describes the type of backlight the TV uses, so it\u2019s been an easy technology for manufacturers to enhance. There are currently a few popular choices in LED TVs including QLED and Mini-LED.\\n2. QLED TVs\\nQLED TVs use LEDs as the backlight, but a QLED TV has quantum dots layered over LED diodes. These dots are really tiny, and each one lights up as an individual colour when the backlight shines on them. Quantum dots enhance an LED TV, but your picture quality will be even better if you choose a QLED TV with Mini-LED.\\nYou can read more about QLED TVs in this post about QLED TVs explained.\\n3. Mini-LED TVs\\nMini-LED is a new backlight technology. Mini-LEDs are a type of LED, but they much smaller so you can pack thousands and thousands of Mini-LEDs into the same space you could only fit hundreds of LEDs. The more lights your TV has, the better control it will have for colour, contrast, and detail.\\nMini-LEDs provide the backlight for QLED TVs, so if you choose a Mini-LED you\u2019ll have a TV with a layer of quantum dots to enhance the colour even further. LG also has their own take on QLED with Mini-LED called Quantum Dot NanoCell.\\nThe difference between a 4K LED TV and a QLED TV is striking. The picture will appear brighter and sharper and tiny detail will be very noticeable. Colours will be very vivid, and when the screen goes black, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a deep, dark black and not grey-ish. Mini-LED TVs create such a spectacular display that they run second only to OLED in terms of picture quality.\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"Do any of those brands sell a laptop that can run a video game without any issues?

When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"That sounds like a good plan.

The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display.

To decide on the best resolution for you, it\u2019s helpful to know a few terms.\\n1. Resolution\\nResolution is the number of vertical pixels or dots that make up your TV\u2019s picture. Whether you have a 55-inch TV or a 30-inch TV, the more pixels your display has the better the overall image quality. You want your resolution to match the content you\u2019re watching, so if you normally watch a lot of 4K content, you\u2019ll want to choose a TV with 4K resolution.\\nYou can read more about pixels and resolution in the 4K TV Buying Guide.\\n2. Aspect ratio\\nAspect ratio is the ratio of the height to width of the display. It\u2019s important because it indicates how the TV can display different resolutions without stretching or adding blank space around the picture.\\n3. 1080P, 4K, or 8K resolution\\nThere are a few different resolutions you can choose when buying a new TV: 1080p Full HD, 4K, and 8K.\\n1080p TV has two million pixels (1920 x 1080)\\n4K Ultra HD TV has eight million pixels (3840 x 2160)\\n8K TV has approximately thirty-three million pixels (7,680 by 4,320)\\n4K is currently the most popular option for TVs. The picture quality is outstanding, there is a wide variety of choices for brand and TV type with 4K resolution, and you\u2019ll find 4K content on all streaming services including Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and many more. 8K TVs are available, but online content hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that level of resolution. If you\u2019re looking for a TV you can enjoy for years to come, a 4K TV is a great choice.\\nLED, QLED, or OLED\\nThere are a lot of different types of TV, but the main three terms you\u2019ll hear the most right now are LED, QLED, and OLED. You can also take a look at this article on Full array TV.\\n1. LED TVs\\nLED TVs are a popular display choice. LED stands for light emitting diode, and TVs of this type use hundreds or thousands of LEDs are the light source for the display. You can find LED TVs in 1080p, 4K, and 8K, with Ultra HD LED TVs being the most popular right now.\\nThe term LED describes the type of backlight the TV uses, so it\u2019s been an easy technology for manufacturers to enhance. There are currently a few popular choices in LED TVs including QLED and Mini-LED.\\n2. QLED TVs\\nQLED TVs use LEDs as the backlight, but a QLED TV has quantum dots layered over LED diodes. These dots are really tiny, and each one lights up as an individual colour when the backlight shines on them. Quantum dots enhance an LED TV, but your picture quality will be even better if you choose a QLED TV with Mini-LED.\\nYou can read more about QLED TVs in this post about QLED TVs explained.\\n3. Mini-LED TVs\\nMini-LED is a new backlight technology. Mini-LEDs are a type of LED, but they much smaller so you can pack thousands and thousands of Mini-LEDs into the same space you could only fit hundreds of LEDs. The more lights your TV has, the better control it will have for colour, contrast, and detail.\\nMini-LEDs provide the backlight for QLED TVs, so if you choose a Mini-LED you\u2019ll have a TV with a layer of quantum dots to enhance the colour even further. LG also has their own take on QLED with Mini-LED called Quantum Dot NanoCell.\\nThe difference between a 4K LED TV and a QLED TV is striking. The picture will appear brighter and sharper and tiny detail will be very noticeable. Colours will be very vivid, and when the screen goes black, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a deep, dark black and not grey-ish. Mini-LED TVs create such a spectacular display that they run second only to OLED in terms of picture quality.\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\n---\\nGaming TVs have low input lag so your controllers match the action on screen. They also have fast refresh rate, with some models offering 120Hz for blistering fast gameplay. You can choose a gaming TV with a gamer hub to give you access to all of your console and PC games in one spot. Take a look at all of the features on gaming TVs by checking out the gaming TV buying guide.\\n2. TVs for the techie\\nIf you\u2019re someone who likes to upgrade their TV as soon as there is exciting new technology available, you\u2019ll love the latest TV releases. The newest TVs have AI processors that adapt to your favourite content, enhancing picture quality on the fly. They can also upscale older video. If you choose a new 4K TV, your must-watch 1080p movies can be upscaled to as close as 2K or 4K as possible.\\nYou\u2019ll find new TV releases from big brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG. Choose from the latest OLED TVs with improved colour volume for the brightest, boldest picture possible. There are newly released QLED TVs, and some also use an ultra-bright Mini-LED backlight paired with a quantum dot overlay for stunning true to life colour and imagery.\\n3. TVs at low prices\\nIf you\u2019re on a budget you can find a TV you\u2019ll love for less than $500. There are low priced gaming TVs and smart TVs, and you can choose a TV on sale in sizes ranging from 32 inches up to 69 inches. You\u2019ll want to check back every day for new TVs on sale, and you can also find open box or refurbished TVS for a great price.\\nHow much should I expect to pay for my new TV?\\nHow much you pay for your new TV will depend on the screen size, resolution, and type of TV you choose. The least expensive TVs right now are 1080p Full HD resolution, and you\u2019ll find these TVs are smaller, have a simpler backlight like edge lighting or simple LED, and have limited port options for connecting cable boxes or gaming consoles.\\nIn terms of a 4K TV, you\u2019ll pay less for a 4K LED with limited connection options than you would for a 4K QLED with Mini-LED backlight and features like multiple HDMI 2.1 ports. The most expensive type of TV right now is OLED, with 8K OLED more expensive than a 4K OLED.\\nYou\u2019ll also pay more for a larger screen size, so if you\u2019re debating a 65-inch TV vs a 75-inch TV, you\u2019ll pay more for the larger panel.\\nTake the next step\\nAre you ready to bring home your new TV? Buy a new TV now by shopping online or in-store at Best Buy.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\nOLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. An OLED TV does not have a backlight like an LED. It uses thousands of diodes that are self-illuminating, and each diode can turn off and on individually. OLED TVs can display millions of colour variations and they are the only TV that can display \u2018true black\u2019 because the diodes can turn completely off or on. If you stand in front of a 4K OLED TV you\u2019ll be blown away by the colour of every image, how dark the blacks are in a night scene with stars, and how everything looks vivid and almost better than real life.\\nYou can learn more about how OLED works by reading OLED vs QLED \u2013 What should your next TV be?\\nFeatures to look for when buying a new TV\\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the options on different TVs.\\n1. Refresh rate\\nRefresh rate refers to how often your screen refreshes. If you have a 60Hz refresh rate, it will refresh 60 times every second. If you have a 120Hz refresh rate, your TV will refresh 120 times per second. If you have a gamer in the house or you watch fast-paced sports, you\u2019ll love how smooth action is when you have a TV with 120Hz. If you\u2019re just watching movies or TV, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz won\u2019t be that noticeable to you. Many of the latest TVs offer 120Hz refresh rate as a standard feature.\\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, you may want to take a look at the best gaming TVs of 2021.\\n2. HDMI and USB ports\\nWhen you buy a TV you\u2019ll want to take a look at the different ports it has. If you have a lot of external devices like cable boxes, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles, you\u2019ll want to make sure your new TV has enough spots to plug in all of your devices. Most new TVs have three HDMI ports, one HDMI ARC port for a soundbar or home receiver, and one or two USB ports. HDMI has also evolved to HDMI 2.1, and this upgrade supports higher resolution video and 4K refresh rates at 120Hz. If you have a gamer in the house, you\u2019ll want to choose a new TV with HDMI 2.1.\\n3. HDR\\nNew TVs have HDR (High Dynamic Range) as an option. Having HDR on your TV means your TV can produce better peak brightness, deeper black levels, and auto-adjust for improved contrast overall. The result is picture quality that\u2019s more realistic and authentic than a TV without HDR. Many of the latest TVs now offer HDR10 as the standard format.\\n4. Smart TVs\\nMost of the latest TVs are also smart TVs. They connect to your Wi-Fi and have pre-loaded apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ pre-installed. Some smart TVs have voice control too, so you can just say \u201cOK Google, open up YouTube.\u201d\\nYou can learn more about the different types of smart TVs by reading Learning about smart TV operating systems.\\n5. Sound quality\\nNew TVs have built-in speakers and use technology to boost and define output for movies, TV shows, and music. While the sound quality of a new TV is always going to be great, if you\u2019d like to boost it so you can enhance dialogue or put more emphasis on sound effects, you can choose a sound bar for an instant sound upgrade. You can find sound bars at various price points, some have additional speakers like subwoofers, and many offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so you can stream your playlists too.\\nSpecific types of TVs you can choose\\nOne of the easiest ways to choose a new TV is to find one based on your specific interest. There are gaming TVs and zTVs for the tech enthusiast. If you\u2019d like to stick to a low budget, you can also choose TVs under $500.\\n1. TVs for gamers\\nGaming TVS are a favourite among gamers for quite a few reasons. Gaming TVs have features built in to make console gaming a seamless experience.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything.

When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"This is all great information, but it's a lot to digest.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"It's great to see so many options, but I have high standards for video editing and I want to be able to do this reliably.

Both of these laptops offer excellent displays, powerful processors, and sufficient RAM for video editing tasks.\\n\\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) features a stunning Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion technology, which provides a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and animations. This can be particularly beneficial when working with video content, as it reduces motion blur and provides a more fluid viewing experience. The Apple M2 Pro chip offers exceptional performance, and the laptop comes with up to 32GB of unified memory, ensuring smooth multitasking and efficient video editing.\\n\\nThe Dell XPS 15 (9520) is another excellent choice, with a 15.6-inch 4K UHD+ display that offers 100% Adobe RGB coverage, providing accurate colors for professional video editing. It is powered by up to a 12th Gen Intel Core i9 processor and can be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM, making it a powerful machine for handling demanding video editing software.\\n\\nBoth laptops offer ample storage options with SSDs, ensuring fast data access and improved overall performance. Additionally, they have good build quality, comfortable keyboards, and precise trackpads, making them suitable for long hours of work.\\n\\nIn summary, if you prioritize a high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate and prefer the macOS ecosystem, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) is an excellent choice. However, if you prefer Windows and want a larger display with 4K resolution and 100% Adobe RGB coverage, the Dell XPS 15 (9520) is a fantastic alternative.', 'turn': 3, 'knowledge_used': 'You can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\nOLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. An OLED TV does not have a backlight like an LED. It uses thousands of diodes that are self-illuminating, and each diode can turn off and on individually. OLED TVs can display millions of colour variations and they are the only TV that can display \u2018true black\u2019 because the diodes can turn completely off or on. If you stand in front of a 4K OLED TV you\u2019ll be blown away by the colour of every image, how dark the blacks are in a night scene with stars, and how everything looks vivid and almost better than real life.\\nYou can learn more about how OLED works by reading OLED vs QLED \u2013 What should your next TV be?\\nFeatures to look for when buying a new TV\\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the options on different TVs.\\n1. Refresh rate\\nRefresh rate refers to how often your screen refreshes. If you have a 60Hz refresh rate, it will refresh 60 times every second. If you have a 120Hz refresh rate, your TV will refresh 120 times per second. If you have a gamer in the house or you watch fast-paced sports, you\u2019ll love how smooth action is when you have a TV with 120Hz. If you\u2019re just watching movies or TV, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz won\u2019t be that noticeable to you. Many of the latest TVs offer 120Hz refresh rate as a standard feature.\\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, you may want to take a look at the best gaming TVs of 2021.\\n2. HDMI and USB ports\\nWhen you buy a TV you\u2019ll want to take a look at the different ports it has. If you have a lot of external devices like cable boxes, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles, you\u2019ll want to make sure your new TV has enough spots to plug in all of your devices. Most new TVs have three HDMI ports, one HDMI ARC port for a soundbar or home receiver, and one or two USB ports. HDMI has also evolved to HDMI 2.1, and this upgrade supports higher resolution video and 4K refresh rates at 120Hz. If you have a gamer in the house, you\u2019ll want to choose a new TV with HDMI 2.1.\\n3. HDR\\nNew TVs have HDR (High Dynamic Range) as an option. Having HDR on your TV means your TV can produce better peak brightness, deeper black levels, and auto-adjust for improved contrast overall. The result is picture quality that\u2019s more realistic and authentic than a TV without HDR. Many of the latest TVs now offer HDR10 as the standard format.\\n4. Smart TVs\\nMost of the latest TVs are also smart TVs. They connect to your Wi-Fi and have pre-loaded apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ pre-installed. Some smart TVs have voice control too, so you can just say \u201cOK Google, open up YouTube.\u201d\\nYou can learn more about the different types of smart TVs by reading Learning about smart TV operating systems.\\n5. Sound quality\\nNew TVs have built-in speakers and use technology to boost and define output for movies, TV shows, and music. While the sound quality of a new TV is always going to be great, if you\u2019d like to boost it so you can enhance dialogue or put more emphasis on sound effects, you can choose a sound bar for an instant sound upgrade. You can find sound bars at various price points, some have additional speakers like subwoofers, and many offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so you can stream your playlists too.\\nSpecific types of TVs you can choose\\nOne of the easiest ways to choose a new TV is to find one based on your specific interest. There are gaming TVs and zTVs for the tech enthusiast. If you\u2019d like to stick to a low budget, you can also choose TVs under $500.\\n1. TVs for gamers\\nGaming TVS are a favourite among gamers for quite a few reasons. Gaming TVs have features built in to make console gaming a seamless experience. You can plug your console in and your TV will automatically detect it and choose the best settings for your specific game.\\n---\\nBefore you buy a new TV, you\u2019ll need to decide on TV resolution and TV backlight. To decide on the best resolution for you, it\u2019s helpful to know a few terms.\\n1. Resolution\\nResolution is the number of vertical pixels or dots that make up your TV\u2019s picture. Whether you have a 55-inch TV or a 30-inch TV, the more pixels your display has the better the overall image quality. You want your resolution to match the content you\u2019re watching, so if you normally watch a lot of 4K content, you\u2019ll want to choose a TV with 4K resolution.\\nYou can read more about pixels and resolution in the 4K TV Buying Guide.\\n2. Aspect ratio\\nAspect ratio is the ratio of the height to width of the display. It\u2019s important because it indicates how the TV can display different resolutions without stretching or adding blank space around the picture.\\n3. 1080P, 4K, or 8K resolution\\nThere are a few different resolutions you can choose when buying a new TV: 1080p Full HD, 4K, and 8K.\\n1080p TV has two million pixels (1920 x 1080)\\n4K Ultra HD TV has eight million pixels (3840 x 2160)\\n8K TV has approximately thirty-three million pixels (7,680 by 4,320)\\n4K is currently the most popular option for TVs. The picture quality is outstanding, there is a wide variety of choices for brand and TV type with 4K resolution, and you\u2019ll find 4K content on all streaming services including Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and many more. 8K TVs are available, but online content hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that level of resolution. If you\u2019re looking for a TV you can enjoy for years to come, a 4K TV is a great choice.\\nLED, QLED, or OLED\\nThere are a lot of different types of TV, but the main three terms you\u2019ll hear the most right now are LED, QLED, and OLED. You can also take a look at this article on Full array TV.\\n1. LED TVs\\nLED TVs are a popular display choice. LED stands for light emitting diode, and TVs of this type use hundreds or thousands of LEDs are the light source for the display. You can find LED TVs in 1080p, 4K, and 8K, with Ultra HD LED TVs being the most popular right now.\\nThe term LED describes the type of backlight the TV uses, so it\u2019s been an easy technology for manufacturers to enhance. There are currently a few popular choices in LED TVs including QLED and Mini-LED.\\n2. QLED TVs\\nQLED TVs use LEDs as the backlight, but a QLED TV has quantum dots layered over LED diodes. These dots are really tiny, and each one lights up as an individual colour when the backlight shines on them. Quantum dots enhance an LED TV, but your picture quality will be even better if you choose a QLED TV with Mini-LED.\\nYou can read more about QLED TVs in this post about QLED TVs explained.\\n3. Mini-LED TVs\\nMini-LED is a new backlight technology. Mini-LEDs are a type of LED, but they much smaller so you can pack thousands and thousands of Mini-LEDs into the same space you could only fit hundreds of LEDs. The more lights your TV has, the better control it will have for colour, contrast, and detail.\\nMini-LEDs provide the backlight for QLED TVs, so if you choose a Mini-LED you\u2019ll have a TV with a layer of quantum dots to enhance the colour even further. LG also has their own take on QLED with Mini-LED called Quantum Dot NanoCell.\\nThe difference between a 4K LED TV and a QLED TV is striking. The picture will appear brighter and sharper and tiny detail will be very noticeable. Colours will be very vivid, and when the screen goes black, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a deep, dark black and not grey-ish. Mini-LED TVs create such a spectacular display that they run second only to OLED in terms of picture quality.\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4.

Everyday laptops are versatile and suitable for most users, including students, professionals, and casual users. 2-in-1 laptops offer the flexibility of a laptop and a tablet in one device, making them great for multimedia consumption and note-taking. Gaming laptops are designed for high-performance gaming and often have powerful components and large displays.\\n\\nWhen choosing a laptop, consider the following components:\\n\\nCPU: The brain of the laptop, responsible for processing instructions. Look for a CPU with a higher clock speed and more cores for better performance.\\nRAM: Temporary storage for data that the laptop is actively using. More RAM allows for better multitasking and faster performance. Aim for at least 8GB of RAM for most users, and 16GB or more for power users or gamers.\\nStorage: Laptops typically use either a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD) for storage. SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs, but also more expensive. Consider the amount of storage you need based on your files and applications.\\nDisplay: The size and resolution of the display can impact your viewing experience. Look for a display with a resolution of at least 1920x1080 (Full HD) for clear and sharp images.\\nOther features to consider include wireless connectivity, ports for accessories, keyboard and trackpad quality, webcam and microphone, built-in speakers, battery life, and weight. Additionally, consider how upgradable the laptop is, as this can impact its lifespan and value.\\n\\nBased on your needs, I would recommend looking for a laptop with a powerful CPU, plenty of RAM, and fast storage.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

This ensures that the colors you see on the screen are accurate and consistent, which is crucial for your work in Photoshop and Final Cut Pro.\\n- **Resolution and Refresh Rate**: The laptop typically comes with a 4K UHD display, which provides sharp and detailed images. The high refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz or 144Hz) ensures smooth visuals, which is beneficial for both video editing and gaming.\\n\\n### Graphics Card\\n- **Importance**: A dedicated graphics card is essential for tasks like video editing and gaming. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus often comes with high-end NVIDIA GeForce RTX series graphics cards, which provide the necessary power for rendering and processing intensive tasks.\\n- **Recommendation**: Prioritize a good graphics card over a larger screen size, especially if you need to handle demanding applications and games.\\n\\n### Other Factors to Consider\\n- **Processor**: The Intel Core i7 processor in the ASUS ROG Zephyrus is powerful and can handle multitasking and intensive applications with ease.\\n- **RAM**: With 32GB of RAM, you can run multiple applications simultaneously without experiencing lag or performance issues.\\n- **Storage**: The 1', 'turn': 7, 'knowledge_used': 'Before you buy a new TV, you\u2019ll need to decide on TV resolution and TV backlight. To decide on the best resolution for you, it\u2019s helpful to know a few terms.\\n1. Resolution\\nResolution is the number of vertical pixels or dots that make up your TV\u2019s picture. Whether you have a 55-inch TV or a 30-inch TV, the more pixels your display has the better the overall image quality. You want your resolution to match the content you\u2019re watching, so if you normally watch a lot of 4K content, you\u2019ll want to choose a TV with 4K resolution.\\nYou can read more about pixels and resolution in the 4K TV Buying Guide.\\n2. Aspect ratio\\nAspect ratio is the ratio of the height to width of the display. It\u2019s important because it indicates how the TV can display different resolutions without stretching or adding blank space around the picture.\\n3. 1080P, 4K, or 8K resolution\\nThere are a few different resolutions you can choose when buying a new TV: 1080p Full HD, 4K, and 8K.\\n1080p TV has two million pixels (1920 x 1080)\\n4K Ultra HD TV has eight million pixels (3840 x 2160)\\n8K TV has approximately thirty-three million pixels (7,680 by 4,320)\\n4K is currently the most popular option for TVs. The picture quality is outstanding, there is a wide variety of choices for brand and TV type with 4K resolution, and you\u2019ll find 4K content on all streaming services including Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and many more. 8K TVs are available, but online content hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that level of resolution. If you\u2019re looking for a TV you can enjoy for years to come, a 4K TV is a great choice.\\nLED, QLED, or OLED\\nThere are a lot of different types of TV, but the main three terms you\u2019ll hear the most right now are LED, QLED, and OLED. You can also take a look at this article on Full array TV.\\n1. LED TVs\\nLED TVs are a popular display choice. LED stands for light emitting diode, and TVs of this type use hundreds or thousands of LEDs are the light source for the display. You can find LED TVs in 1080p, 4K, and 8K, with Ultra HD LED TVs being the most popular right now.\\nThe term LED describes the type of backlight the TV uses, so it\u2019s been an easy technology for manufacturers to enhance. There are currently a few popular choices in LED TVs including QLED and Mini-LED.\\n2. QLED TVs\\nQLED TVs use LEDs as the backlight, but a QLED TV has quantum dots layered over LED diodes. These dots are really tiny, and each one lights up as an individual colour when the backlight shines on them. Quantum dots enhance an LED TV, but your picture quality will be even better if you choose a QLED TV with Mini-LED.\\nYou can read more about QLED TVs in this post about QLED TVs explained.\\n3. Mini-LED TVs\\nMini-LED is a new backlight technology. Mini-LEDs are a type of LED, but they much smaller so you can pack thousands and thousands of Mini-LEDs into the same space you could only fit hundreds of LEDs. The more lights your TV has, the better control it will have for colour, contrast, and detail.\\nMini-LEDs provide the backlight for QLED TVs, so if you choose a Mini-LED you\u2019ll have a TV with a layer of quantum dots to enhance the colour even further. LG also has their own take on QLED with Mini-LED called Quantum Dot NanoCell.\\nThe difference between a 4K LED TV and a QLED TV is striking. The picture will appear brighter and sharper and tiny detail will be very noticeable. Colours will be very vivid, and when the screen goes black, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a deep, dark black and not grey-ish. Mini-LED TVs create such a spectacular display that they run second only to OLED in terms of picture quality.\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\n---\\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\\n4. OLED TVs\\nOLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. An OLED TV does not have a backlight like an LED. It uses thousands of diodes that are self-illuminating, and each diode can turn off and on individually. OLED TVs can display millions of colour variations and they are the only TV that can display \u2018true black\u2019 because the diodes can turn completely off or on. If you stand in front of a 4K OLED TV you\u2019ll be blown away by the colour of every image, how dark the blacks are in a night scene with stars, and how everything looks vivid and almost better than real life.\\nYou can learn more about how OLED works by reading OLED vs QLED \u2013 What should your next TV be?\\nFeatures to look for when buying a new TV\\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the options on different TVs.\\n1. Refresh rate\\nRefresh rate refers to how often your screen refreshes. If you have a 60Hz refresh rate, it will refresh 60 times every second. If you have a 120Hz refresh rate, your TV will refresh 120 times per second. If you have a gamer in the house or you watch fast-paced sports, you\u2019ll love how smooth action is when you have a TV with 120Hz. If you\u2019re just watching movies or TV, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz won\u2019t be that noticeable to you. Many of the latest TVs offer 120Hz refresh rate as a standard feature.\\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, you may want to take a look at the best gaming TVs of 2021.\\n2. HDMI and USB ports\\nWhen you buy a TV you\u2019ll want to take a look at the different ports it has. If you have a lot of external devices like cable boxes, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles, you\u2019ll want to make sure your new TV has enough spots to plug in all of your devices. Most new TVs have three HDMI ports, one HDMI ARC port for a soundbar or home receiver, and one or two USB ports. HDMI has also evolved to HDMI 2.1, and this upgrade supports higher resolution video and 4K refresh rates at 120Hz. If you have a gamer in the house, you\u2019ll want to choose a new TV with HDMI 2.1.\\n3. HDR\\nNew TVs have HDR (High Dynamic Range) as an option. Having HDR on your TV means your TV can produce better peak brightness, deeper black levels, and auto-adjust for improved contrast overall. The result is picture quality that\u2019s more realistic and authentic than a TV without HDR. Many of the latest TVs now offer HDR10 as the standard format.\\n4. Smart TVs\\nMost of the latest TVs are also smart TVs. They connect to your Wi-Fi and have pre-loaded apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ pre-installed. Some smart TVs have voice control too, so you can just say \u201cOK Google, open up YouTube.\u201d\\nYou can learn more about the different types of smart TVs by reading Learning about smart TV operating systems.\\n5. Sound quality\\nNew TVs have built-in speakers and use technology to boost and define output for movies, TV shows, and music. While the sound quality of a new TV is always going to be great, if you\u2019d like to boost it so you can enhance dialogue or put more emphasis on sound effects, you can choose a sound bar for an instant sound upgrade. You can find sound bars at various price points, some have additional speakers like subwoofers, and many offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so you can stream your playlists too.\\nSpecific types of TVs you can choose\\nOne of the easiest ways to choose a new TV is to find one based on your specific interest. There are gaming TVs and zTVs for the tech enthusiast. If you\u2019d like to stick to a low budget, you can also choose TVs under $500.\\n1. TVs for gamers\\nGaming TVS are a favourite among gamers for quite a few reasons. Gaming TVs have features built in to make console gaming a seamless experience. You can plug your console in and your TV will automatically detect it and choose the best settings for your specific game.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades.

The bad news is that the capacity of SSDs is still lower than HDDs, and the price per gigabyte is higher. So you\u2019ll need to decide how much storage you need and how much you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\\nThe minimum capacity for a laptop is 128GB, but that\u2019s really only suitable for a Chromebook.

If you\u2019re a gamer, you\u2019ll need at least 512GB, and 1TB is a better option. If you\u2019re a content creator, you\u2019ll need at least 1TB, and 2TB is a better option.\\nDisplay: size, resolution, and type\\nThe display is the most important part of a laptop, as it\u2019s the main way you interact with it. The size of the display is measured diagonally, and the most common sizes are 13-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch. The resolution is the number of pixels in the display, and the most common resolutions are Full HD (1920 x 1080), 4K UHD (3840 x 2160), and 8K UHD (7680 x 4320). The type of display is the technology used to create the image, and the most common types are LCD, LED, and OLED. LCD displays are the most common, and they\u2019re usually the most affordable. LED displays are brighter and more energy-efficient than LCD displays, and OLED displays offer the best image quality, but they\u2019re also the most expensive.\\n---\\nLaptop brands\\nThere are many laptop brands to choose from, and the best one for you will depend on your needs and budget.

Apple laptops', 'turn': 1, 'knowledge_used': 'Laptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

It has a comfortable key travel distance and a responsive feel, making it suitable for extended typing sessions. It's not as premium as some high-end laptops, but it's quite good for the price.\\n- **Warranty**: Acer typically offers a one-year limited warranty on their laptops, which covers defects in materials and workmanship. This warranty usually includes repair or replacement of the laptop if something goes wrong within the first year. However, it does not cover accidental damage, so you might want to consider purchasing an extended warranty or accidental damage protection if available.\\n- **Touchscreen**: Since you don\u2019t need a touchscreen, opting for a non-touchscreen model will indeed save you money. Touchscreens add to the cost and are not necessary for basic tasks like web browsing and word processing.\\n- **Display**: For the display, look for a Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution for a sharp and clear image. IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels are generally better for viewing angles and color accuracy compared to TN (Twisted Nematic) panels. However, IPS panels can be more expensive, so you might need to balance cost and quality.\\n- **Ports**: The Acer Aspire 5 typically comes with a good selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card reader.

Refurbished items are typically products that have been returned to the manufacturer or retailer, often due to minor issues or cosmetic defects. These items are then inspected, repaired if necessary, and tested to ensure they meet the original specifications. They are usually sold at a discounted price but come with some form of warranty, which provides added peace of mind.\\n\\nUsed products, on the other hand, are second-hand items sold as-is, often without any warranty or guarantee of quality.\\n\\n### Tips for Choosing a Refurbished Laptop\\n\\n1. **Check the Warranty**: Ensure the refurbished laptop comes with a warranty. This protects you in case something goes wrong.\\n2. **Inspect the Condition**: Look for details on the condition of the laptop. Most refurbished products are graded (e.g., like-new, good, acceptable), so you know what to expect.\\n3. **Read Reviews**: Check reviews from other buyers to see if they had any issues with the refurbished laptop.\\n4. **Buy from Reputable Sources**: Purchase from well-known retailers or manufacturers. They often have stricter refurbishment processes.\\n5. **Check the Return Policy**: Make sure the retailer has a good return policy in case you're not satisfied with the product.\\n6. **Look for Certifications**: Some refurbished products come with certifications that guarantee they meet certain quality standards.\\n\\n### What to Look Out For\\n\\n1. **Battery Life**: Refurbished laptops may have older batteries. Check the battery health and consider replacing it if necessary.\\n2. **Cosmetic Issues**: Minor scratches or dents are common with refurbished items, but ensure they don't affect the functionality.\\n3. **Software**: Make sure the laptop comes with the operating system and necessary drivers installed. Some refurbished laptops may come with a clean install of the OS.\\n4. **Performance**: Test the laptop thoroughly to ensure it performs as expected. Run benchmarks or stress tests if possible.\\n5. **Accessories**: Check if the laptop comes with all necessary accessories, like the charger and manuals.\\n\\n### Is Refurbished a Good Option for You?\\n\\nRefurbished laptops can be an excellent option if you're looking to save money and don't mind minor cosmetic issues. They often come with a warranty, which provides some protection.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"I've got a tight budget for this, so that could be a deal breaker for me.\\nI also want to be able to travel or work with this device easily.

They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': 'Yes, that would be helpful.

On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"What kind of video editing software do I need to buy to edit my videos on my YouTube channel if I buy the MacBook?

They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nGaming TVs have low input lag so your controllers match the action on screen. They also have fast refresh rate, with some models offering 120Hz for blistering fast gameplay. You can choose a gaming TV with a gamer hub to give you access to all of your console and PC games in one spot. Take a look at all of the features on gaming TVs by checking out the gaming TV buying guide.\\n2. TVs for the techie\\nIf you\u2019re someone who likes to upgrade their TV as soon as there is exciting new technology available, you\u2019ll love the latest TV releases. The newest TVs have AI processors that adapt to your favourite content, enhancing picture quality on the fly. They can also upscale older video. If you choose a new 4K TV, your must-watch 1080p movies can be upscaled to as close as 2K or 4K as possible.\\nYou\u2019ll find new TV releases from big brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG. Choose from the latest OLED TVs with improved colour volume for the brightest, boldest picture possible. There are newly released QLED TVs, and some also use an ultra-bright Mini-LED backlight paired with a quantum dot overlay for stunning true to life colour and imagery.\\n3. TVs at low prices\\nIf you\u2019re on a budget you can find a TV you\u2019ll love for less than $500. There are low priced gaming TVs and smart TVs, and you can choose a TV on sale in sizes ranging from 32 inches up to 69 inches. You\u2019ll want to check back every day for new TVs on sale, and you can also find open box or refurbished TVS for a great price.\\nHow much should I expect to pay for my new TV?\\nHow much you pay for your new TV will depend on the screen size, resolution, and type of TV you choose. The least expensive TVs right now are 1080p Full HD resolution, and you\u2019ll find these TVs are smaller, have a simpler backlight like edge lighting or simple LED, and have limited port options for connecting cable boxes or gaming consoles.\\nIn terms of a 4K TV, you\u2019ll pay less for a 4K LED with limited connection options than you would for a 4K QLED with Mini-LED backlight and features like multiple HDMI 2.1 ports. The most expensive type of TV right now is OLED, with 8K OLED more expensive than a 4K OLED.\\nYou\u2019ll also pay more for a larger screen size, so if you\u2019re debating a 65-inch TV vs a 75-inch TV, you\u2019ll pay more for the larger panel.\\nTake the next step\\nAre you ready to bring home your new TV?

Look for Intel Core i7 or i9, AMD Ryzen 7 or 9, or Apple's M1\/M2 chips.\\n\\n2. **RAM**: For smooth multitasking and handling large files, aim for at least 16GB of RAM.

Look for at least 512GB of storage, but 1TB or more would be ideal for storing large video files.\\n\\n4. **Graphics Card (GPU)**: For video editing and 3D modeling, a dedicated graphics card is important. Look for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series or AMD Radeon RX 6000 series.\\n\\n5. **Display**: A high-resolution display with good color accuracy is crucial for video editing. Look for a laptop with a 4K UHD display or at least Full HD with good color gamut coverage.\\n\\n6. **Battery Life**: Since you'll be using the laptop on the go, good battery life is important. Look for a laptop that offers at least 8 hours of battery life.\\n\\n7. **Ports**: Make sure the laptop has enough ports for your peripherals.

Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"Thank you for the detailed explanations, it's very helpful.

They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video\/power support).\\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\\nBattery life\\nWeight\\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"I won't be gaming or needing something that doubles as a tablet, so the everyday laptops sound like what I need.

With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"...backlit keyboards, which can be helpful if you work in low-light conditions.

However, with proper care and maintenance, you can extend the lifespan of your laptop significantly. Here are some tips to help prolong the lifespan of your Acer laptop:\\n\\n1. **Avoid Overheating**: Overheating is a common issue that can damage your laptop's internal components. To prevent overheating, avoid using your laptop on soft surfaces like beds or couches, which can block the vents. Use a laptop cooling pad if necessary, and clean the vents regularly to remove dust and debris.\\n\\n2. **Handle with Care**: Be gentle with your laptop to avoid physical damage. Avoid dropping it, bumping it, or exposing it to extreme temperatures. When transporting your laptop, use a protective case or sleeve.\\n\\n3. **Keep it Clean**: Regularly clean your laptop's screen, keyboard, and ports to remove dirt, dust, and grime. Use a microfiber cloth and a mild cleaning solution to clean the screen, and compressed air to clean the keyboard and ports.\\n\\n4. **Update Software Regularly**: Keep your laptop's operating system and drivers up to date to ensure optimal performance and security. Software updates often include bug fixes and improvements that can extend the lifespan of your laptop.\\n\\n5. **Avoid Deep Discharges**: Try to avoid letting your laptop's battery drain completely before recharging it. Deep discharges can shorten the lifespan of your battery. Instead, try to keep your battery level between 20% and 80% for optimal battery health.\\n\\n6. **Use a Surge Protector**: Power surges can damage your laptop's internal components. Use a surge protector to protect your laptop from power fluctuations and surges.\\n\\n7. **Avoid Heavy Loads**: While it might be tempting to run multiple resource-intensive applications at once, doing so can put a strain on your laptop's components and shorten its lifespan. Try to use your laptop for lighter tasks when possible.\\n\\n8. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically check your laptop's hardware components, such as the hard drive and RAM, for any signs of failure. Replace any failing components as soon as possible to prevent further damage.\\n\\n9. **Use Antivirus Software**: Protect your laptop from malware and viruses by using reputable antivirus software. Malware can cause significant damage to your laptop's operating system and files.\\n\\n10. **Avoid Eating or Drinking Near Your Laptop**: Spills and crumbs\", 'turn': 4, 'knowledge_used': '', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': 'Yeah, yeah, I know the usual stuff.

To do this, fully charge your laptop, then let it discharge completely. After it shuts down, charge it back to 100% without interruption. This helps recalibrate the battery gauge for more accurate battery life readings.\\n\\n2. **Acer Care Center**: Use the Acer Care Center software that comes pre-installed on your laptop. This tool helps you monitor your laptop's health, update drivers, and perform system diagnostics.\\n\\n3. **Fan Maintenance**: Acer laptops can sometimes suffer from fan issues, which can lead to overheating. Regularly clean the fans and ensure they are functioning properly. You can use compressed air to blow out dust from the vents.\\n\\n4. **BIOS Updates**: Keep your laptop's BIOS up to date. Acer occasionally releases BIOS updates that can improve performance, fix bugs, and enhance compatibility with new hardware and software.\\n\\n5. **Avoid Cheap Power Adapters**: Use the original Acer power adapter or a high-quality replacement. Cheap power adapters can damage your laptop's battery and internal components over time.\\n\\nRegarding battery life, it depends on your usage patterns. If you need a laptop that you can use all day without access to a power outlet, look for models with longer battery life. However, if you primarily use your laptop at home or in an office with easy access to power, a shorter battery life might be acceptable.\\n\\nMost modern Acer laptops come with non-removable batteries, which means you cannot replace the battery yourself. If the battery dies, you will need to take your laptop to a professional repair service or contact Acer support for a replacement. Some older Acer models may have removable batteries, so it's worth checking your specific model.\\n\\nWhen comparing Acer laptop models, pay attention to the battery life specifications. Acer provides estimated battery life ratings for each model, which can give you an idea of how long the laptop will last on a single charge.

A higher capacity generally means longer battery life.\\n\\n2. **Power-Efficient Components**: Opt for laptops with power-efficient processors, such as Intel's U-series or Y-series CPUs, or AMD's U-series APUs. These processors are designed to consume less power, extending battery life.\\n\\n3. **Display**: Choose a laptop with a display that has good power efficiency. IPS panels are generally more power-hungry than TN panels, but they offer better viewing angles and color accuracy. Consider a laptop with a display that has a lower resolution or refresh rate, as these factors can also impact battery life.\\n\\n4. **Keyboard Backlighting**: While convenient, keyboard backlighting can consume additional power. If battery life is a top priority, you might want to consider a laptop without this feature or one that allows you to turn it off.\\n\\n5. **Ports and Connectivity**: Ensure the laptop has the ports and connectivity options you need, such as USB, HDMI, and Wi-Fi. However, avoid laptops with unnecessary features that can drain the battery, like built-in DVD drives.\\n\\nRegarding price drops, laptop prices can fluctuate throughout the year due to various factors, such as new product releases, sales events, and holidays. Here are some tips to help you find the best deals:\\n\\n1. **Black Friday and Cyber Monday**: These annual sales events, which take place the day after Thanksgiving and the following Monday, respectively, often feature significant discounts on laptops and other electronics.\\n\\n2. **Amazon Prime Day**: If you're an Amazon Prime member, keep an eye out for Prime Day, which typically takes place in July. This sales event offers deep discounts on a wide range of products, including laptops.\\n\\n3. **Back-to-School Sales**: Retailers often offer discounts on laptops and other back-to-school essentials during the summer months. If you're a student or know someone who is, this can be a great time to find a deal.\\n\\n4. **Holiday Sales**: Many retailers offer discounts on laptops and other electronics during the holiday season, from Thanksgiving to Christmas.

Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\\nTake the next step\\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops. Best Buy has a laptop to fit any size, capability, and budget.\\nShop Laptops at Best Buy\\n---\\nLaptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\n---\\nTypes of laptops\\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\\nLaptop components\\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\\n---\\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\\nThe display\\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\\nOther components\/features worth considering\\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard', 'recommended_items_count': 0}, {'speaker': 'Shopper', 'text': \"Wow, that's a lot to take in.

Windows laptops come in various form factors, including traditional clamshell laptops, 2-in-1s, and gaming laptops.\\n2. **MacBook (macOS)**: Known for their build quality, display, and integration with other Apple devices. MacBooks are popular among creative professionals and those already invested in the Apple ecosystem. However, they tend to be more expensive and have fewer hardware customization options.\\n3. **Chromebook (Chrome OS)**: Lightweight and affordable, Chromebooks run on Google's Chrome OS and are designed for web-based tasks. They have limited offline functionality and may not support all software you're used to. Chromebooks are great for students, casual users, and those who primarily use web applications.\\n\\n**Laptop Types**:\\n\\n1. **Everyday Laptops**: These are standard laptops designed for general use, such as browsing the web, working on documents, and streaming media. They typically have a good balance of performance, portability, and battery life.\\n2. **2-in-1 Laptops**: These versatile devices can function as both a laptop and a tablet. They usually have a touchscreen and can be folded flat or detached from the keyboard. 2-in-1s are great for users who want the flexibility of a tablet and the productivity of a laptop.\\n3. **Gaming Laptops**: Designed for playing modern games, these laptops have powerful processors, dedicated graphics cards, and high-refresh-rate displays. They tend to be larger, heavier, and more expensive than other laptop types. Gaming laptops also have better cooling systems to handle the heat generated during intense gaming sessions.\\n\\nNow that you have a better understanding of the platforms and laptop types, do you have any preferences or specific needs that can help narrow down your choices?
